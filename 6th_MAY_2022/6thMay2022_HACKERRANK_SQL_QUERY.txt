Exists/not exist:

here,working is different like outer query will run every row and check whether it meets the condition
of inner query or not. As inner query returns only TRUE OR FALSE if it fufills or not fulfill the condition
respectively.
If FALSE is returned then that row will not get printed in the result.


COUNT:
SELECT COUNT(CITY)-COUNT(DISTINCT(CITY)) FROM STATION;

q2) Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well 
as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city,
 choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.
The STATION table is described as follows:

ANSWER : 
SELECT TOP 1  CITY,LEN(CITY) FROM STATION
WHERE LEN(CITY)=
(SELECT MIN(LEN(CITY)) FROM STATION)
ORDER BY CITY ASC;


SELECT TOP 1 CITY,LEN(CITY) FROM STATION
WHERE LEN(CITY)=
(SELECT MAX(LEN(CITY)) FROM STATION)
ORDER BY CITY ASC;


q3)Query the list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. 
Your result cannot contain duplicates.

ANswer:
SELECT DISTINCT(CITY) FROM STATION 
WHERE CITY LIKE 'a%' OR
CITY LIKE 'e%' OR
CITY LIKE 'i%' OR
CITY LIKE 'o%' OR
CITY LIKE 'u%';

q4)Query the list of CITY names ending with vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from STATION.
 Your result cannot contain duplicates.
Answer: 
SELECT DISTINCT(CITY) FROM STATION 
WHERE CITY LIKE '%a' OR
CITY LIKE '%e' OR
CITY LIKE '%i' OR
CITY LIKE '%o' OR
CITY LIKE '%u';


Q5)Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
Answer: 
SELECT DISTINCT(CITY) FROM STATION
WHERE
UPPER(SUBSTR(CITY,LENGTH(CITY),1)) NOT IN ('A','E','I','O','U')
AND 
LOWER(SUBSTR(CITY,LENGTH(CITY),1)) NOT IN ('a','e','i','o','u')
ORDER BY CITY;
